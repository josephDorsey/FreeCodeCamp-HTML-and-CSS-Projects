# Introduction to Basic CSS
`Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)` tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

Note that `CSS` is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.

`CSS` has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions

There are *three main ways to apply CSS styling.* You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code.

The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.

In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your CatPhotoApp can change it from simple text to something more.

# Basic CSS: Change the Color of Text
Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the color style property.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .

Change your h2 element's style so that its text color is red.

# Basic CSS: Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2> Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red.

Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'.

# Basic CSS: Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element.

# Basic CSS: Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:

h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
Inside the same <style> tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for p elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px).
