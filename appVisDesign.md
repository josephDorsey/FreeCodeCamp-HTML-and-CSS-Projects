# Applied Visual Design: Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the `text-align` property.

`text-align: justify;` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

`text-align: center;` centers the text

`text-align: right;` right-aligns the text

And `text-align: left;` (the default) left-aligns the text.

Align the `h4` tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded.

# Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

img {
  width: 220px;
}
Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the fullCard class to select the element.

# Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property

You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:

img {
  height: 20px;
}
Add a height property to the h4 tag and set it to 25px.

Note: You may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the test on this challenge.

# Applied Visual Design: Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold
To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

Wrap a strong tag around "Stanford University" inside the p tag (do not include the period).

# Applied Visual Design: Use the u Tag to Underline Text

To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

Wrap the u tag only around the text "Ph.D. students".

Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.

# Applied Visual Design: Use the em Tag to Italicize Text
To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.

Wrap an em tag around the contents of the paragraph tag to give it emphasis.
